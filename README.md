# Week1_Code_refactor

I made the following changes.

## Style.css
1. Replace benefit-lead, benefit-brand, and benefit-cost classes  with benefit-content.
2.  Replaced benefit-lead h3, benefit-brand h3, benefit-cost h3 with benefit-content h3.  I did the same for the benefit-lead img, benefit-brand img, and benefit-cost img classes.
3. Changed the classes search-engine-optimization, online-reputation-management, and social-media-marketing classes to content-section.
4.  Changed search-engine-optimization h2, online-reputation-management h2, and social-media-marketing h3 classes to content-section h2, and search-engine-optimization img, online-reputation-management img, and social-media-marketing img classes to content-section img.

## index.html
1. Change benefit-lead, benefit-brand, and bennefit-cost classes to benefit-section
2. Added the search-engine-optimization id to the div with that class so the link in the nav would work.
3. Updated the title.
4. Added alt tags to the images.
5.  Added semantic tags header, section, aside, and footer.
