I made the following changes.

## Style.css
1. Move delete the style for p and mvoe the font into the body tag.
2. Replace benefit-lead, benefit-brand, and benefit-cost classes  with benefit-content.
3.  Replaced benefit-lead h3, benefit-brand h3, benefit-cost h3 with benefit-content h3.  I did the same for the benefit-lead img, benefit-brand img, and benefit-cost img classes.
4. Changed the classes search-engine-optimization, online-reputation-management, and social-media-marketing classes to content-section.
5.  Changed search-engine-optimization h2, online-reputation-management h2, and social-media-marketing h3 classes to content-section h2, and search-engine-optimization img, online-reputation-management img, and social-media-marketing img classes to content-section img.

## index.html
1. Change benefit-lead, benefit-brand, and bennefit-cost classes to benefit-section
2. Added the search-engine-optimization id to the div with that class so the link in the nav would work.
